## Installation

So far we are offering two different variants for the installation. You can choose between [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) or pre-built binaries which are stored on our download mirrors and GitHub releases. Maybe we will also provide system packages for the major distributions later if we see the need for it.

### Docker

TBD

### Binaries

TBD

## Quickstart

Following https://github.com/owncloud/ocis#development

```console
git clone https://github.com/owncloud/ocis.git
cd ocis
make build
mkdir /var/tmp/reva/root/{home,oc}
```

Open http://localhost:9100 and login using one of the demo accounts:

```console
einstein:relativity
marie:radioactivty
richard:superfluidity
```

## Runtime

Included with the ocis binary is embedded a go-micro runtime that is in charge of starting services as a fork of the master process. This provides complete control over the services. Ocis extensions can be added as part of this runtime.

```console
./bin/ocis micro
```

This will currently boot:

```console
com.owncloud.api
com.owncloud.http.broker
com.owncloud.proxy
com.owncloud.registry
com.owncloud.router
com.owncloud.runtime
com.owncloud.web
go.micro.http.broker
```

Further ocis extensions can be added to the runtime via the ocis command like:

```console
./bin/ocis hello
```

Which will register:

```console
com.owncloud.web.hello
com.owncloud.api.hello
```

To the list of available services.

## Configuration

We provide overall three different variants of configuration. The variant based on environment variables and commandline flags are split up into global values and command-specific values.

### Envrionment variables

If you prefer to configure the service with environment variables you can see the available variables below.

#### Global

OCIS_LOG_LEVEL
: Set logging level, defaults to `info`

OCIS_LOG_COLOR
: Enable colored logging, defaults to `true`

OCIS_LOG_PRETTY
: Enable pretty logging, defaults to `true`

#### Server

OCIS_DEBUG_ADDR
: Address to bind debug server, defaults to `0.0.0.0:9010`

OCIS_DEBUG_TOKEN
: Token to grant metrics access, empty default value

OCIS_DEBUG_PPROF
: Enable pprof debugging, defaults to `false`

OCIS_HTTP_ADDR
: Address to bind http server, defaults to `0.0.0.0:9000`

OCIS_HTTP_ROOT
: Root path for http endpoint, defaults to `/`

OCIS_GRPC_ADDR
: Address to bind grpc server, defaults to `0.0.0.0:9001`

OCIS_SERVICES_ENABLED
: List of enabled services, defaults to `phoenix,konnectd,graph,ocs,webdav,hello`

#### Health

OCIS_DEBUG_ADDR
: Address to debug endpoint, defaults to `0.0.0.0:9010`

### Commandline flags

If you prefer to configure the service with commandline flags you can see the available variables below.

#### Global

--log-level
: Set logging level, defaults to `info`

--log-color
: Enable colored logging, defaults to `true`

--log-pretty
: Enable pretty logging, defaults to `true`

#### Server

--debug-addr
: Address to bind debug server, defaults to `0.0.0.0:9010`

--debug-token
: Token to grant metrics access, empty default value

--debug-pprof
: Enable pprof debugging, defaults to `false`

--http-addr
: Address to bind http server, defaults to `0.0.0.0:9000`

--http-root
: Root path for http endpoint, defaults to `/`

--grpc-addr
: Address to bind grpc server, defaults to `0.0.0.0:9001`

--services-enabled
: List of enabled services, defaults to `hello,phoenix,graph,graph-explorer,ocs,webdav,reva-frontend,reva-gateway,reva-users,reva-auth-basic,reva-auth-bearer,reva-sharing,reva-storage-root,reva-storage-home,reva-storage-home-data,reva-storage-oc,reva-storage-oc-data,devldap`

#### Health

--debug-addr
: Address to debug endpoint, defaults to `0.0.0.0:9010`

### Configuration file

So far we support the file formats `JSON` and `YAML`, if you want to get a full example configuration just take a look at [our repository](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/tree/master/config), there you can always see the latest configuration format. These example configurations include all available options and the default values. The configuration file will be automatically loaded if it's placed at `/etc/ocis/ocis.yml`, `${HOME}/.ocis/ocis.yml` or `$(pwd)/config/ocis.yml`.

## Usage

The program provides a few sub-commands on execution. The available configuration methods have already been mentioned above. Generally you can always see a formated help output if you execute the binary via `ocis --help`.

### Server

The server command is used to start the http and debug server on two addresses within a single process. The http server is serving the general webservice while the debug server is used for health check, readiness check and to server the metrics mentioned below. For further help please execute:

{{< highlight txt >}}
ocis server --help
{{< / highlight >}}

### Health

The health command is used to execute a health check, if the exit code equals zero the service should be up and running, if the exist code is greater than zero the service is not in a healthy state. Generally this command is used within our Docker containers, it could also be used within Kubernetes.

{{< highlight txt >}}
ocis health --help
{{< / highlight >}}

## Metrics

This service provides some [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) metrics through the debug endpoint, you can optionally secure the metrics endpoint by some random token, which got to be configured through one of the flag `--debug-token` or the environment variable `OCIS_DEBUG_TOKEN` mentioned above. By default the metrics endpoint is bound to `http://0.0.0.0:8001/metrics`.
